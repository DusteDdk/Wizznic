Most awesome puzzle game
===
Wizznic! is a difficult puzzle game with built-in puzzle-editor.

Complete each puzzle by destroying all bricks. Bricks are destroyed by moving them next to each other. It's a lot more difficult than it sounds.

Builds
======
Automatically (read:untested) builds are available for Linux, Windows and Wiz here:

Boring parts

The code is here on github, there's some reading material in the doc directory.
