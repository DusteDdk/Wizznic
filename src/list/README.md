# A Doubly Linked List in C
This is just a small, simple doubly linked list implementation I did for fun.
The headerfile should be selv-explanitory, otherwise, the examples in main.c will surely explain how to use it. It is intended for static linkage, so just copy the list.c and list.h files to your project and include list.h to start using it.
make lib - generates the list as a static and shared lib
make test - generates a binary which exercieses the lib.
